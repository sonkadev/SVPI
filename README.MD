#### First of all, do NOT use LightDM, using it can cause more problems with VEGAS Pro, and can make it crash for no fucking reason.
Now you need to do the following steps:
- Start the installer.
- There will be a log while installing (above the progress bar).
- When it says 'registering modules', wait for a bit.
- After registering modules the log will be empty, when it's empty, **press cancel**.
- You're done, yippee

###### VEGAS Pro may crash when closing the newsfeed.
